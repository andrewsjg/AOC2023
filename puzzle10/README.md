# Solution for [Puzzle 10](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10)

Part 1 of this puzzle was pretty straight forward. Part 2 was tricky. I figured out the basic strategy quick enough, but I needed a couple of hints as to dealing with the corners in the pipes. I just couldnt see how it would work.

I even drew out own of the example loops just to be able to visualise it. I did consider doing it graphically, but it was quicker just to quickly draw it out on a grid to see where I was going wrong.

Even knowing the basic approach, it took me ages to figure out so it worked for all loops. I kept hitting edge cases which shouldnt have been there!

But I enjoyed this one and I am pleased with my approach. It didnt require any thing to complicated.
